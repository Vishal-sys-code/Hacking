**Why do we do MAC spoofing**?

_Taking over another's computer identity. <br>Changing the role of computer to router and viceversa. <br>
As a way to do a MITM attack._

**Why do we change the MAC Address**?

```
So being able to change your MAC address to another device's MAC address will allow you to impersonate this device and allow you to do things that might not be able to do.

So you'd be able to bypass filters or connect to network that only specific device with specific MAC address can connect to, and you will also be able to hide your identity.

**Legimate Reason for Hacking the MAC**

An example of the legimate use of MAC spoofing is changing the function of a single computer from router to a computer and back to the router through MAC spoofing.
<br>
If you only have a single public IP, you can only hook up one unit directly(PC or router).
<br>
If one has two WAN IPs, the MAC address of the two devices must be different.
<br>
For whatever reason, if you needs to swap 2 PC's regularly to connect to the cable modem, it would be a lot easier to change the MAC addresses rather than to change the Network Interface Card(NIC). <br>

**NON-Legimate Reason for Hacking the MAC**

An example of an illegimate use is when an attacker changes the MAC address of his station to enter a target network as an authorized user, taking over a computer's identity that is authorized to function on the network.
<br>
With this new identity an attacker can wreak havoc: For example to launch denial of service attacks or bypassing access control mechanisms to advance more intrusion. <br>
An attacker might choose to cahnge one's MAC address in an attempt to evade network intrusion detection systems, to become invisible to security measures, allowing more time to act without detection. <br>
