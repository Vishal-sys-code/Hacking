MAC Spoofing can be a big problem on shared segment networks. However, the current generations of Ethernet switches are offering us a basis for defeating this kind of intrusion by offering is MAC locking.

## **MAC LOCKING**
* It is possible to lock a MAC address to a specific physical port on the switch.

* When MAC-locking locks a MAC/port combination, it prevents the MAC address from being used from any other port on the segment.

* This combined with static ARP and MAC/IP filters could totally eradicate the spoofing possibilities on a shared segment network.

* Expensive, managed switches allow port locking, but the disadvantage is the overhead cost.

## **Using ARP Tables**
