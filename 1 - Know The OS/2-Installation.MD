# Installation

There are two ways to use Kali Linux. <br>

- Either boot a system with a Kali and have a dedicated system. <br>
- Or virtually install a kali in your Windows or Mac system. <br>

Prefer the second way and to do this we will need a software Virtual Box in which we will virtually install Kali Linux. <br>

<p> Download and Install it from: <a href = "https://tinyurl.com/y8u2qut3">Kali Linux</a> </p> <br>

After Intalling Virtual Box go to official website of Kali and download it. <br>

<p>Kali Linux : <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yartvbb9">www.kalilinux.com</a></p> <br>

You will get a ```.ova``` file. It is virtual image file, just double click it and it will automatically get opened in the virtual box. <br>

Simply import it and it's done. <br>

Click on the start button and the top it will boot up Kali for you. <br>

The only web browser you will find pre installed in the Kali Linux is the ```FireFox```. <br>
